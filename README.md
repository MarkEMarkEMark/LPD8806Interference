LPD8806Interference
===================

This is a new complex pattern for LED Strip LPD8806

Requires https://github.com/adafruit/LPD8806 and http://www.adafruit.com/products/306)

It overlays the 3 RGB channels with levels decided by sine waves.

There are various parameters to tweak, but I've predefined a number of interesting types using the variable "pattern"

(Please note that this code has been ripped from my own G35 Xmas lights project, and made standalone - this is why the loop code is so bad!!!)
